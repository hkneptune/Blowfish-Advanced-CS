2005-03-30	Version	2.55.00.109

NEW:

- added Format item to the file browser's popup menu

CHANGED:

- Blowfish Advanced CS is now officially released under the Apache 2.0 license
- there is now a new home both for the source and the binaries at SourceForge,
  with the homepage set to <http://bfacs.sf.net>

--------

2005-03-27	Version	2.54.00.133

NEW:

- cipher information now available in "Options..Security..Encryption Algorithm"

FIXED:

- Force	Compression	option wasn't documented in	the	help files
- on some Win95/98/Me systems the switch to	new	folders	was	delayed	by a couple
  of seconds; this has been	fixed -	the	new	solution should	also fix some other
  problems with	the	automatic browser refresh

--------

2005-02-09	Version	2.53.00.023

NEW:

- menu item	for	Blowfish Advanced CS homepage

FIXED:

- Job files	couldn't be	created	at all (embarassing, really), also note	that
  versions of bfaCS	older than 2.50	cannot process the new ones	anymore
- the Windows Explorer status bar showed the selected file/folder names	in
  nonprintable characters under	WinNT+ (and	some misprints also	on Win9x/Me)
- Edit field in	the	New	Folders	dialog didn't offer	a horizontal scrollbar

--------

2005-02-06	Version	2.52.00.122

NEW:

- Browse (for Folder) dialogs are now in the modern	style (wherever	available),
  which	mainly means that they are resizable and do	support	some drag and drop

CHANGED:

- the installer	I used was an old InstallShield	Express	from 1998, which seems
  to have caused problems; I purchased the latest version and I	hope it	now
  should all work out well;	it also	saves around 250kB per download
- improved wiping: user	breaks won't discard data which	hasn't been	overriden
  so far (led to truncated files) 
- more transparency	in the Progress	dialog:	wipe cycle progress	is displayed as
  well as repeated encryption operations in	case a file	cannot be compressed
  
FIXED:

- some minor flicker in	the	Progress dialog

--------

2005-02-04	Version	2.51.00.203

CHANGED:

- destination path is now copied from the Key Input	to the Destination dialog

FIXED:

- the maximized	main window, if	mazimized, was set back	to its original	size
  after	any	kind of	action (encryption,	wiping,	...)

--------

2005-02-02	Version	2.50.00.042

NEW:

- better compression methods are now available:	deflate	(ZIP) and the even
  better (well,	in most	cases) BZIP2 algorithm;	note that such files can't be
  decrypted	by older versions of bfaCS (2.13 and below)	or BFA97!
- changed the layout of	the	progress bars in the Progress dialog and the Clear
  Empty	Disk Space dialog
- updated control layout in	Progress dialog, looks better now IMHO
- a	regular	install/uninstall distribution is now available
- Windows Server 2003 and Longhorn get detected	(in	the	About dialog)
- support for native Windows XP	controls
- new option in	the	Configuration: "Force Compression" avoids startover	if
  files	are	not	compressable - with	a slight increase of the output	file sizes
- Caps Lock	warning	in the password	dialog,	implemented	as a tip
- the Clear	Empty Disk Space dialog	can	be minimized at	runtime
- all the executables are now shipped in a compressed format, which	lets the
  whole	distibution	fit	on an ancient 720kB	floppy disk!

CHANGED:

- switched password	input hiding style to use asterisks
- updated extension	list of	noncompressable	files
- only one external	DLL	(bfacslib) is now required to run BFACS.EXE; CryptPak
  stays	internal and has also been updated (cipher cleanup)	for	the	future
- Help system has been updated to HTML help, requires the presence of IE to	run
  (only	a matter if	you	have older versions	of Windows 95)
- Yarrow is	the	only random	number generator now, made more	sense
- transparent window support have been removed (wasn't stable/good enough)
- the license model	back is	back to	commercial,	yet	the	one	and	only kind is the
  Personal Edition,	so it is and will stay free	- and the source stays public,
  however development is now done with a Delphi	5 Professional

FIXED:

- Unicode filenames	have never been	stored (NT wasn't detected correctly)
- removed a	couple of memory and resource leaks, thanks	to MemChk
- reencryption sometimes produced new files	with readonly/hidden attributes
- status bar kept saying "wiping" even after the end of	a "work	with" cycle

--------

2002-08-05	Version	2.13.00.001

NEW:

- bfaCS	compiles now completely	with freeware, Borland Delphi 6
  (Personal	Edition) and the Borland C/C++ Compiler	5.5	(BCC55)

CHANGED:

- bundled with now with	the	latest CryptPak	4.06

FIXES:

- icon in "Yes No All Cancel" (YNAC) message box was not opaque
- Rename Dialog	and	(YNAC) message box could not be	made transparent
- task bar icon	menu was not inactive during Decryption	work
- triple-DES bug in	the	key	setup (WARNING:	files encrypted
  with triple-DES of older versions	will _not_ decrypt with
  this fix anymore,	reencryption is	recommended)

--------

2001-04-03	Version	2.12.00.011

NEW:

- transparent windows (Windows 2000	and	higher,	not	every control could	be
  made transparent yet,	I hope for better support in Windows XP	or Delphi 6)
- recognizes Windows 2000/Me/XP
- includes the latest CryptPak DLL 4.02

FIXES:

- crashed during the execution of programs and documents in	the	browser
- problems and/or (internal) exceptions	with multiple folder creation

CHANGES:

- the software reads out its version number	directly form the EXE file
  and now uses the standard	x.xx.xx.xxx	format
- browser in details mode allows now row selection

--------

- shortcut CTRL+V for viewing now works	(changed CTRL+N	to select 
  encrypted	files)

CHANGES:

- new CryptPak API (uses now Yarrow	internally)

- it was possible to shutdown the program via the system tray
  during a disk	clear process
- list in the about	box	was	not	readonly
- increase of performance of the file browser and the job report

CHANGES:

- Blowfish Advanced	CS is now freeware/open	source!

--------

2000-03-02	Version	2.09.077

NEW:

- popup	menu contains now entries for the most common operations

- internal error fixed (access violations sometimes	during shutdown)

--------

2000-01-31	Version	2.06.008

FIXES:

- key disks	could not be read at all, heavy	bug	and	thus
  a	quick fix is essential (thanks Lasse, for the hint)

  showed an	OK button instead of Yes/All/No/Cancel

- auto confirmation	didn't work	if a new charater was not entered
  at the end of	the	current	password
- new folders are now placed directly after	already	existing folders
- wipe loop	boxes appeared sometimes unnecessarily in the progress dialog
- the caption of the icon in the tray icon was not remaned properly	if
  an action	was	started	e.g. out of	the	Windows	shell
- weak keys	now	lead to	an automatic retry,	not	an error
- file wiping goes now through all caches and buffers

CHANGES:

- the source code of Blowfish Advanced CS is available for review purposes

--------

1999-12-06	Version	2.04.066

FIXES:
- due to changes in	Delphi 5 the favorites and work	files
  entries were accidentially equipped with shortcuts,
  unacceptable flaw	and	thus worth to patch	straightaway
- the history stored equal paths unnecessarily multiple	times

--------

1999-12-05	Version	2.03.103

  dialog sometimes

- disk clearing: cleared size wasn't shown correctly (fixed	also a minor i/o problem)
- nasty	bug: program couldn't exit when	a viewed file was removed manually
- if the program was active	during a windows shutdown it was terminated
  the hard way (no configuration saved,	no viewed files	wiped. etc.)

--------

  the key shortcut
