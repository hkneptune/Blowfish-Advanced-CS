How do I install Blowfish Advanced CS?
--------------------------------------

1. Create a separate directory, e.g. "c:\Program Files\Blowfish Advanced CS"

2. Extract all the files from the archive BFACSxxx.ZIP to this directory. The
   following files are needed to run the program properly:
  
                        BFACS.EXE    - executable
                        BFACSLIB.DLL - core library for Blowfish Advanced CS
                        BFACS_US.CHM - english help file
                        BFACS_US.SR  - english string resources
                        BFACS_DE.CHM - german help file
                        BFACS_SR.SR  - german string resources
                        README.TXT   - this file
                        LIESMICH.TXT - german version of this file
                        CHANGES.TXT  - history of this software

3. Create a shortcut to BFACS.EXE where you like it best.

4. Start the program by clicking on the shortcut. After the first run the file
   BFACS.INI will be created in the same directory where BFACS.EXE is located.

5. Due to the individual configuration files you can install several copies
   with different settings in their own directories, as many as you like. You
   can also run as many instances of one BFACS.EXE as necessary. The settings
   from the last closed instance will then be written to BFACS.INI.

6. If you want to associate .BFA and .BFJ files with Blowfish Advanced CS and
   install the shell extensions go to the "Options..Miscellaneous..Registry
   Setup" in the program.


How to uninstall the software
-----------------------------

1. Remove file associations and shell extensions in the program.

2. Delete the folder where Blowfish Advanced CS is located.
