<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Welcome to Blowfish Advanced
CS, the software for protecting your private files on your
Windows PC and Network.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blowfish Advanced CS is a file
encryption program, protecting your files with a key built from a
password or a key disk, so that noone but you has access to the
contents. Blowfish Advanced CS wipes sensitive files that are no
longer needed, so nobody will be able to restore them. Working
with encrypted files and clearing empty disk space are other
useful features.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today we are in the information
age and encrypting data becomes more and more important for most
of us. There are many reasons why data have to be protected from
unauthorized access, e.g. sensitive medical data, private or
business documents or just some hot stuff from the Internet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are many ways to make data
readable only to selected people. Besides physical measures like
locking removable disks into a safe, or cheap solutions like
hiding files with steganography, the only way to make files
really unaccessible is to use strong cryptography. That means
high-end encryption algorithms with keys long enough to resist
any attacks, combined with secure removal of the original data.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">That's what Blowfish Advanced CS
does, bundled with a richly featured user interface for the daily
work, powered by an universal crypto engine, well integrated in
the Windows environment and able to automate most of the
handling.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><em>Equipped with the most proven
and modern security technologies, capable of encrypting and
wiping even the largest number of files with just a few mouse
clicks, incredibly fast and powerful to use - Blowfish Advanced
CS is one of the top software encryption products available
today.</em></font></p>
