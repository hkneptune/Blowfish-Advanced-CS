<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Reencryption means that you are
able to change the key and the encryption algorithm of encrypted
files with one simple action.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Using the conventional way you
will have to decrypt the files and encrypt them again, changing
the algorithms between those actions. With reencryption you just
provide the old encryption key and algorithm and then declare a
new key and encryption algorithm immediately.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The process keeps everything of
the selected cryptfiles (including their names), the data is not
even uncompressed, but just moved to the new files without any
changes. This leads to a very good performance and increases
security.</font></p>
