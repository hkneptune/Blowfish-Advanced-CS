<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Here you can select which method
should be used when encrypted files are going to be renamed to
hide their original names. The renaming methods does not have an
effect on .BFA extensions being added to an encrypted file or
not.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>User defined rename mask</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You can choose a header and the
extension for renamed files. Blowfish Advanced CS will insert a
running decimal number between these two parts to avoid filename
collisions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Random characters</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Files will be renamed to 8 random
characters, making the file names to look scrambled. Should be
your standard option for renaming files, the chance for
collisions with existing names is hereby very low.</font></p>

<h2><font size="3" face="Arial">Compression</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Don't compress files of type</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some file types are using a
compressed format, making any attempt to squeeze them into
smaller sizes futile . You can tell Blowfish Advanced CS which
file types to ignore when compression is activated.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For that enter their extensions,
separated by commas. With a set of the most compressed file types
you can always work with compression turned on, not risking any
unnecessary retries. The software comes already with such a set
of well known types, most of them archive and multimedia formats.</font></p>
