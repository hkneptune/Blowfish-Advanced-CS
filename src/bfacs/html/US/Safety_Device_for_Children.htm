<p><font size="2" face="Arial">By the same way you keep your car
doors secured against the danger of being opened by children you
can protect Blowfish Advanced CS being used from persons not
knowing what they're doing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As you know the software is able
destroy huge amounts of data within seconds. E.g. if a child is
playing with your computer and discovers Blowfish Advanced CS it
might be possible that files are encrypted or (more possible)
wiped without any chances for recovery.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">By setting a simple password,
which must be entered every time when the program is started, you
can avoid this danger in most of the such cases. Remember that
this is not a protection against any other intruders with bad
intentions, as the password is stored in the configuration file.
If someone can launch applications on your PC without your
knowledge it is easy to destroy data, even without Blowfish
Advanced CS.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You can turn off the safety device
by entering an empty password (not during the startup, of
course).</font></p>
