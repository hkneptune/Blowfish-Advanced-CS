<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With this dialog you can clear the
whole empty file space on the one or multiple drives. The program
will create a temporary file until the disk is full, overwriting
every file information not in use anymore.</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial"><b>Note that
    clearing empty disk space makes file content recovery, even
    for good purposes, impossible!</b></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <em><strong>Setup</strong></em>
allows you to tell Blowfish Advanced CS what and how to clear.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Write through Buffers</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Creating temporary files with
sizes of several GB will make every caching mechanism of Windows
worthless. On the contrary caching might slow down the whole
process or even lock your computer for a long time until all
buffers have been written to disk. To avoid such problems
activate the switch. This should work well for the most cases.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>No Messages</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a drive has been cleared a
message box will appear. The temporary file will be deleted after
this box has been closed. Although Blowfish Advanced CS flushes
all buffers before, it might help in some cases to give Windows
(or even the drives' hardware) some extra time to write down the
rest of the data. However, if you want to clear multiple drives
such message boxes might get annoying and prevent you from doing
the whole job unattended (e.g. during a coffee break). By turning
this switch on you can get rid of the messages.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Low Priority</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You can force Blowfish Advanced CS
to lower its priority during the clearing process, enabling you
to work with other applications (which usually run at a normal
priority) without any significant delays. Please remember that
you will get out of disk space at the end of the clearing, so
watch out when trying to save files in other applications.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Clear</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You can tell the software what to
clear. Either just the <em><b>current location</b></em>, <em><b>all
drives</b></em> (excluding CD-ROM, but including removable
drives) or <em><b>fixed drives</b></em> (hard disks).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Clear with</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The temporary file can either
contain <em><b>zero bytes</b></em> or random data. For random
data you can tell the software to create just one block and using
it again and again (<em><b>static random data</b></em>) or
putting out <em><b>continuous random data</b></em>, which is at
last the slowest method, as the program must create data all the
time, not only at the beginning. It&#146;s is strongly
recommended to use random data when dealing with compressed
drives.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Click on the <em><b>Start</b></em>
button to begin the clearing. If the size of empty disk space (on
the current drive) can be determined a progress bar will appear
on the right. Otherwise the number of bytes written is shown in
the status bar. The process can always be terminated with the <em><b>Cancel</b></em>
button.</font></p>
