<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Having the original names of files
well secured in their encrypted counterparts, scrambled or masked
filenames visible for people without the right key only, is a
basic and useful feature of Blowfish Advanced CS. But sometimes
you might just want to know where a certain encrypted document is
located, e.g. to copy it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Decrypting all candidates would be
a possibility, but is neither very timesaving nor a good matter
of security (if files are getting unprotected, even temporarily).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blowfish Advanced CS offers you a
scanner, some kind of a background task having a quick look in
every file, trying if it's encrypted and, if so, getting the
original file name and size out of its header (assuming that you
have provided the right decryption key), displaying them in extra
columns of the browser.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To work with the scanner you</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">must enter a decryption key
        in the appearing key input dialog. This key is cached
        until the scanner is turned off. In comparison to the
        program's </font><a href="Key_Cache.htm"><font size="2"
        face="Arial">key cache</font></a><font size="2"
        face="Arial"> the scanner key will never expire. Pressing
        the F8 key is a good way to turn off the scanner and get
        rid of the key.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">should switch the browser to
        the Details style. Only then you are able to check out
        the original file names and sizes in the columns
        described above.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The scanner of Blowfish Advanced
CS works very fast, so even directories with many files are
processed in an endurable time. For a better overlook you may
sort the real name column to have the original filenames in
alphabetical order.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the scanner is active you
will see the text SCAN appearing in the status bar. Press F8 or
uncheck the menu item to turn off the scanner at once.</font></p>
