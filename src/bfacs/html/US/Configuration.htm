<p><a name="options_configuration"></a><font size="3"
face="Arial"><b>Configuration</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The configuration contains all
uncategorized switches for Blowfish Advanced CS. Instead of being
spread wildly in different sheets and dialogs you have them all
in a well sorted list for fast and direct access.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Accept Truncated Files</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If encrypted files are cut off due
to any reason (e.g. an aborted download) the software will refuse
to decrypt it. Check this option to force it to decrypt as many
data as possible anyway.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Add .BFA Extension</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You can associate encrypted files
with Blowfish Advanced CS. For that the files must have the
extension .BFA. By activating this switch the extension will be
added to the name of every encrypted file, independent of if it
was renamed or not. E.g. a file with the original name
&quot;MyDiary.txt&quot; will be renamed to
&quot;MyDiary.txt.bfa&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Auto Arrange</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Icons will be automatically
arranged in the browser when the window is resized.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Automatic Browser Refresh</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The software is able to detect if
files and folders have been deleted, created or changed in the
current path. It will then update the browser if this switch is
turned on.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Browser in Web Style</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you prefer the browser to look
and act like a web browser you should check this switch. Item
captions will be underlined and single mouse clicks will be
treated as double clicks.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Colored Progress Display</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Activate this switch if you want
the display boxes in the progress dialog be colored. Encryption
will cause a red, decryption a green, wiping a yellow,
reencryption a blue and deslacking a teal coloring.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Doubleclick equals &quot;Work
With&quot;</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If this switch is turned off
double clicks (including dragging single encrypted files on the
program's window) will cause an encrypted file to be viewed. If
you want to work with instead check this option. This will also
change the behaviour of double clicks on .BFA files in the
Windows Explorer: instead of the selection dialog the program
will immediately start to work with a file.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Exit after a job has been done</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you have started a job (equals
a jobfile or directly provided objects) via the shell or by
dragging objects over the program icon you can force the program
to shutdown after the execution. The only exception is if you
view an encrypted file (it would vanish at once, leaving the
application to view the file behind) the program will stay alive.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Files to view may overwrite
existing ones</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you view encrypted file they
will be decrypted in a temporary directory. Although such
directories usually don't contain any valuable files you can
avoid overwriting existing files by turning this switch on.
Please remember that if you view files multiple times such
overwrite situations will permanently occur and you will get a
warning every time. If you're not sure what's good or wrong you
might define your own temporary path for viewing (see </font><a
href="Miscellaneous.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">Miscellaneous</font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial">).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Flat Browser View</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A gimmick to show the file browser
in the new Windows 98 look-and-feel. May not work propely on
Windows 95 and NT4 systems.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Force Compression</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If a file turns out to be
noncompressable the software starts all over again with
compression turned off. By that the small overhead of the
compressor is removed. While saving space it takes time of course
to repeat the whole cycle. By checking this option data will
always be compressed, even if the final size is actually larger
than the original one (depending on the compression algorithm
this can be up to 12.5%) and by that things will speeded up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Hide Drives</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you don't want to see any
drives in the browser then activate this option. You can still
change the path to any location or drive respectively though.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Hot Tracking</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The mouse pointer selects the item
below automatically after a short delay. Surely a questionably
feature. Like it or not.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Ignore CRC32 Errors</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To check the integrity of
decrypted data Blowfish Advanced CS calculates a CRC32 checksum
and compares it with the one that was stored in the cryptfile. If
these checksums are not equal the original file will not be
restored to give the user the chance to solve the problem. E.g.
to fix a disk error or to transmit the file again. You can set
this switch to pass the integrity check. Then a file will always
be decrypted, even if the data seems to be damaged. Please use
this option with care! Backup the encrypted file to have another
chance for decryption.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Keep Attributes</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If this switch is turned on the
software won't reset the attributes of encrypted files, but keep
their original states. So e.g. hidden files will stay hidden.
Please remember that the original attributes are going to be
stored in a cryptfile, too.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Keep Date+Time Stamps</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If this switch is turned on the
software won't change the date and time of encrypted files. Same
as the attributes the date+time stamps are preserved in the
cryptfiles, too.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Operations must be confirmed</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you turn this switch on
Blowfish Advanced CS will ask explicitly before starting any
process. This option was implemented for power users to avoid
unnecessary requests, especially during the execution of multi
job files. The switch doesn't have any effect for wiping
operations, because it is just too dangerous to take any risks
here.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Overwrite Existing Files</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Check this switch if you want the
software to overwrite existing files without any additional
confirmations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Place Drives First</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Drives will appear at the top of
the browser list.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Remove Empty Directories</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If complete folders are wiped and
empty afterwards, either during a pure wiping process or e.g. if
using a target path, you can let them be removed automatically by
checking this switch. Please remember that if a folder contains
still any files, for what reasons ever, it will not be deleted at
all.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Replace Icons (and Types) of
Scanned Files</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the scanner was able to gain
information from an encrypted file it will show you the real file
name and size in the browser (if in Details style). For better
overall view you might also desire the original icons and the
types of the encrypted files by checking this option. Please note
that the original icons are only shown for documents, not for
executables or other special files.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Run in System Tray</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For a faster access Blowfish
Advanced CS is able to run in the system tray. After minimized
the program will still be active, but you are also able to quit
it via the tray icon menu. You can deactivate this feature, if
you don't like it, here.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Save sensitive Settings</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blowfish Advanced CS keeps its
configuration in the file BFACS.INI, located in the same
directory where BFACS.EXE is.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you turn off this switch the
following information will not be stored in BFACS.INI:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">all paths stored by the
        browser (cleared)</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">the last work path (will be
        set to the temporary directory of Windows)</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">the key disk path (reset to
        default)</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">the last target path
        (cleared)</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">the temporary path for
        viewing files (same as last work path)</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">all algorithms chosen are
        reset to the default cipher (Blowfish)</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">all files of the work list</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Scan .BFA files only</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The scanner will by default scan
all files in the current browser. Usually it makes more sense to
scan only files with the .BFA extension. Such a behaviour can be
activated by checking this switch.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Show Configuration File Errors</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the application cannot store
its configuration into the BFACS.INI file it will pop up a dialog
box if this option is enabled. You may disable it to run
BFACS.EXE from a readonly device like a CD-ROM. But notice that
it still needs a configuration file with this option turned off
to suppress the warning.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Show Gridlines</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Gridlines will be shown if the
browser is set to Details style.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Show Hints</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Here you decide if the </font><a
href="Button_Bar_and_Browser_Controls.htm"><font size="2"
face="Arial">buttons</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">
should be explained with hints. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you are familiar enough with
Blowfish Advanced CS you might turn them off.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Show Job Report</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blowfish Advanced CS logs every
operation and will show the results in the </font><a
href="Job_Report.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">Job Report</font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial"> window afterwards. If you don't want to
see such a resume, turn this switch off. Remember that if any
problem occurred the job report will nevertheless be shown.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Skip already encrypted files</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If this switch is turned on
Blowfish Advanced CS will check if a file is already encrypted.
If so it will not be encrypted a second time. By setting the
switch off you can deactivate this check, forcing the program to
encrypt every file, whether encrypted or not. Please remember
that if you encrypt files multiple times you have to decrypt them
multiple times (in reversed order), too.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Try to rename 8.3 compatible</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When files are encrypted there
might be the possibility that the desired name for the cryptfile
is not supported by the underlying file system. E.g. when dealing
will some servers supporting the DOS namespace only. By setting
this switch on, the software will try to create filenames
compatible to the 8.3 (DOS) format. Remember that this will not
work for decryption. If you don't see any problems with your
environment, just ignore this option and let it turned off.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Turn Off file caching</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When reading and writing data
during encryption and decryption data is cached as usual by the
Windows operation system. Although fine for the daily work it
might just be overhead when dealing with large amounts of files
or data respectively. Here you can force the program to write
through any caches and buffers directly to disk, improving the
speed of execution. In some cases this might also have a negative
effect, especially when dealing with many of very small files.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Write-protect encrypted Files</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With this option set all files
will be write-protected after encryption. This will avoid
mistakes, e.g. if encrypted files are opened in other
applications they can only be viewed, not altered (which may
destroy them).</font></p>
