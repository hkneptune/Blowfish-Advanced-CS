<p><a name="dialog_keyinput"></a><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Key
Input</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Here you put in your key
consisting of a password or a key disk to start encryption or
decryption actions on the files you selected.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The password can be everything, a
single word or a complete sentence. The maximum length of a
password is just limited by the edit control itself (which is
usually around 32kB), assumed that you are running the registered
version (with no key limitations) of Blowfish Advanced CS.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You can also type in the complete
ASCII character set by using <em>binary sequences</em>. E.g. if
you want to have the character with the ASCII code # 8 (that's
the code for the backspace key) at the end of your password named
&quot;special&quot; you just type &quot;special\08&quot;. The
&quot;\08&quot; sequence tells Blowfish Advanced CS to ignore the
&quot;\&quot; prefix and to take the next two characters as the
hexadecimal representation of the ASCII code. If you want to use
the &quot;\&quot; alone you will have to type &quot;\\&quot;. By
this method the key spectrum can be extended easily and
brute-force attacks will be much harder. You may even use zero
bytes in your password, e.g. &quot;sec\00ret&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If the password cannot be detected
with the Auto Confirmation turned on or if Auto Confirmation is
turned off you will have to enter the password (for encryption
purposes only) a second time to avoid typing mistakes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There will be a warning appearing
in case the <em>Caps Lock Key</em> is enabled. This protects you
from accidentally and unintentially entering passphrases with
capital letters, one of the most common input errors made.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Please read the </font><a
href="Security_aspects.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">security
aspects</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> to avoid flaws
when choosing your password.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Use the <em><b>Apply</b></em>
button to fix changes permanently.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The following items are visible
for every action:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Use Cached Key</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If a key is available the </font><a
href="Key_Cache.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">key cache</font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial"> and you want to use it, so turn on this
switch. All other key input controls will then be disabled.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Show Password</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If your are sure that nobody (not
even a hidden camera) has the possibility to look over your
shoulder you can turn on this switch to see your password instead
of the blank characters. Blank characters are much better to hide
a password instead of the usual asterisks, because it is harder
for someone to guess the length of the password when one has the
chance to peep.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Auto Confirmation</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Confirming a password again and
again gets boring after a while. With Auto Confirmation turned on
Blowfish Advanced CS will remember the password you entered and
confirmed. If you enter the password later again the program
detects it and continues without further requests. The key input
dialog will be closed as soon as your password is recognized, so
you mustn't even touch the enter key. This saves a lot of time
and avoids typing errors which occur even with confirmations.
After retyping a password again and again it gets so common that
you may even duplicate a wrong key-stroke.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Cache Key</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you want the key you are
entering to be put into the program's </font><a
href="Key_Cache.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">key cache</font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial"> then check this switch. Remember that when
you are entering multiple keys the resulting big key will be put
into the cache, not the single one.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Multi Key Input</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blowfish Advanced CS allows you to
concatenate several keys. You can combine passwords and key file
contents in any order you want to. This allows you e.g. to secure
your key disk with an additional password (like a PIN number). If
the key disk was stolen one will still need the password to have
access to your data. Another example is to need two persons to
access a secret document: both of them use their own password or
key disk and are only able to decrypt the data together. Multi
keys are entered by activating the switch. You will then be asked
after every key input if another key is going to be entered.
After all keys are provided they are linked together (in the
order they were put in) and treated as one big single key. So if
the first password e.g. was &quot;123&quot; and the second one
&quot;456&quot; the resulting key is &quot;123456&quot;. For
decryption you may enter &quot;123456&quot; instead of two single
keys, of course.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Use Key Disk</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Activate this switch if you want
to use a keydisk instead of a password. A keydisk is a
(preferably removable) disk, usually a conventional 3.5&quot;
floppy disk, with a defined key file on it. By default this file
is located at &quot;A:\BFACSKEY&quot;, but you can </font><a
href="Miscellaneous.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">change this
setting</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> in the options
dialog. There you can also create a key disk with secure random
data. Insert the key disk only at the time when Blowfish Advanced
CS wants to read it. That will be shortly after you leave the key
input dialog with the &quot;OK&quot; button. Using key files is
the right choice for those people who have problems to remember
or don't want to remember passwords. It is also a fine feature
for sharing keys in a small workgroup. </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Please backup your
key disks!</strong> </font><font size="2" face="Arial">If a key
disk is lost your data encrypted with the key file will be gone. </font><font
color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Keep key disks at a
safe place!</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><b> </b>If
someone has access to them one will be able to copy it and then
decrypt all your encrypted data.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">These items are only available for
encryption:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Compress</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blowfish Advanced CS can compress
file data before encrypting it. By setting this switch you can
turn on data compression. If a file cannot be compressed, e.g.
multimedia files like JPEG or archives like ZIP, it is stored in
an non-compressed form to avoid wasting disk space. Please check
this out, because the program tries to compress every file and
starts a second time, with compression temporarily turned off.
You may also tell the software what </font><a
href="File_Handling.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">filetypes
not to compress</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">.
Compression is time-consuming, due to that the whole process
slows down. But on highly compressable documents, like text files
or spreadsheet tables it does not only save disk space, but
increases the security, too. Cryptanalysis on compressed data is
much harder then on uncompressed data.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Store Original Pathnames</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Storing pathnames is useful if you
want to keep complete directory structures, but don't want to
leave the files at their original locations. The original
pathname of a file will be stored encrypted in the header of the
cryptfile. If you decrypt the file its original path will be
restored. E.g. if you encrypt the file
&quot;D:\Documents\Private\mydiary.doc&quot; with pathname
storing on and you decrypt the encrypted file (with activated
pathname restoring) to the target path &quot;E:\Backups&quot; the
original file will be recreated as
&quot;E:\Backups\Documents\Private\mydiary.doc&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Rename Files</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Activating this option will cause
a complete renaming of encrypted files, so nobody can predict
anything about what was in your file when the original name and
extension have vanished. Depending on the </font><a
href="File_Handling.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">settings in
the options dialog</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> files
will be renamed either with random characters or with an
enumerated name masking. There you can also choose if the program
should add the </font><a href="Configuration.htm"><font size="2"
face="Arial">.BFA extension</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">
to encrypted files.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Relative To Current Path</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This switch is only enabled if you
store original pathnames. If it's checked pathnames will only be
store relatively to the current path of the browser. E.g. if
you're in &quot;E:\Backups\Documents&quot; and encrypt the file
&quot;E:\Backups\Documents\Private\mydiary.doc&quot; the original
path and name will be saved as &quot;Private\mydiary.doc&quot;.
Otherwise the complete path will be stored, in our case
&quot;Backups\Documents\Private\mydiary.doc&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For decryption only this item is
available:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Restore Original Path</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you have encrypted files with
their pathnames (either relatively to the base path or not) you
can recreate the directory structures by checking this switch. If
you let it unchecked, the original pathname will be ignored.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For encryption and decryption
these items are available:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Keep Directories</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you are using a target path you
can force the software to keep all directories and recreate them
at the new location. E.g. if you are in
&quot;E:\Backups\Documents&quot; and your target path is
&quot;D:\Documents&quot; an encrypted file like
&quot;E:\Backups\Documents\Private\mydiary.doc.bfa&quot; will be
decrypted to &quot;D:\Documents\Private\mydiary.doc&quot;. It is
not recommended to combine this option with the restoring of
pathnames for decryption.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Use Destination Path</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">By default files will be written
at the same place where the original files (either encrypted or
unencrypted) were located. If you want to have the files at
another location, e.g. for backup purposes, you can type in a
destination if the switch is turned on. Use the <b>Browse...</b>
button to select a previously entered pathname from the list (or
to browse for a new folder). In combination with the store and
restore pathnames switches you can recreate complete directory
structures where you want them to be.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Remove Source Files</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you encrypt or decrypt files to
a destination the process is similar like copying with encryption
or decryption afterwards. By activating this switch the source
files will be wiped (for encryption) or deleted (for decryption
purposes), so the process is similar to moving files.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For reencryption these items are
available<u>:</u></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Old/New Encryption Algorithm</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You can select a new encryption
algorithm for the files or provide the previously chosen
algorithm respectively. You may also use the same algorithm for
reencryption, but then you should at last change the encryption
key. Otherwise the results would be the same. Please remember
that even if you're using the same key and don't change the
algorithm the reencrypted files will be totally different in
their content. This is because every time your key is combined
with a random value (salt). For more information please read the </font><a
