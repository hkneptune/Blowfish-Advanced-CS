<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Handling files is easy to manage
with Blowfish Advanced CS, nevertheless it might always be the
same work if you have to encrypt, decrypt, wipe, deslack or
reencrypt the same files and folders every day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To automate the daily work
Blowfish Advanced CS offers you job files. A job is nothing more
than a description which tells the program what to do and how to
do it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">E.g. when you have encrypted a
number of files you can save this action in a job file. For that
use the </font><a href="Job_Report.htm"><font size="2"
face="Arial">job report</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">
dialog. If you want to execute the same job again just click on
the job file. Then you will not have to select the files again,
you won't have to set up the original options and the right
encryption algorithm, you will not have to reselect the target
path - you just have to type in the password or insert the
keydisk. You may even add another job to an existing jobfile.
When the jobfile is executed every job stored in it will be
processed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">E.g. you may create a job file
which contains decryption jobs at your sensitive files for the
everyday work day in the office. In the morning you will just
have to start the jobfile, enter the key and that's it. By the
same way create the counterpart to this jobfile, which encrypts
your files. Just add some jobs for clearing up, e.g. to wipe all
temporary Internet files, and you have the jobfile to start when
leaving the office.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you have </font><a
href="Miscellaneous.htm"><font size="2" face="Arial">associated
file types</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> you can launch
a job file directly from the shell, not having to start Blowfish
Advanced CS manually. How about placing the daily decryption job
file onto the Windows desktop or into the Startup folder?</font></p>
