<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In this dialog you can create a
secure key disk.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">First insert a blank disk into the
drive declared in the </font><a href="Miscellaneous.htm"><font
size="2" face="Arial">options dialog</font></a><font size="2"
face="Arial">.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Then select an appropriate size
for the key file using the <em><b>Size of</b></em><em> </em><em><b>Key</b></em>
selector. Please remember that the key size is measured in bits
here, and thus is always increased or decreased by 8 (as long as
single bits cannot be store in files). By the way, the maximum
key size is 1024 bits, which is more than overkill for a
symmetric encryption key.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For creating a really good key it
is necessary that the random generator (Yarrow is favorite one
for such purposes) is fed with some random seed before the key
bytes are going to be created. By shacking the mouse pretty well
over the window or by typing on the keyboard you can provide such
random seed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Remember that the window is
resizable to have more space for you mousing around.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As soon as enough random seed was
collected a file dialog appears, in which you're able to change
the name and location of the key file. The creation of the file
itself is just a matter of a second.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Please removed the key disk at
once. After you have decided to use it you should make at last
one backup of it or the key file respectively.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Take care that you do not
overwrite an existing key file by accident!</u></font></p>
