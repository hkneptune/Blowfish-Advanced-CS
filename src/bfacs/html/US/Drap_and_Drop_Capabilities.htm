<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blowfish Advanced CS provides
multiple drag and drop support.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Besides the dragging and dropping
of items inside the </font><a href="Browser.htm"><font size="2"

the program allows drops on its icon and on the program at
runtime.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If a drag and drop action was
detected Blowfish Advanced CS will ask you what to do with the
dropped files and folders. You can select between encrypt,
decrypt, wipe, view, deslack or work with the provided objects.
The software is smart enough to detected single encrypted files
and will either ask you to view or to work with them (depending
on the current configuration). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When objects were dropped on the
program icon you may force the software to shut down after the
job has been done (configurable by an option), which is
especially useful if files and folders were dropped you don't
want to do anything else.</font></p>
