PREREQUISITES

- Delphi 5 Professional. Later versions might work and so might even Delphi 4,
  but I haven't tested this. Make sure that you got the latest fixes, too. The
  path for the Delphi command line compiler (DCC32.EXE) must be declared in the
  PATH environment variable.

- Borland C++ 5.5 Compiler. The path to BCC32.EXE, ILINK32.EXE and MAKE.EXE must
  be declared in the PATH environment variable. Make sure that the right .CFG
  files for compiler and linker and in this path, too. Also make sure that you
  have the latest updates. Older versions 5.0 and 4.x might also work, but this
  hasn't been tested.

- ZIP.EXE, the command line ZIP utility which is available at the InfoZIP site
  <http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/>. The executable must also be in one of
  the paths declared by the PATH environment variable.

- UPX executable packer. Available at <http://upx.sourceforge.net/>. Make sure
  that UPX.XE is in the PATH. The current version used is 1.25 (stable).

- HTML Help workshop. Available at the MSDN website, search for "HTML Help
  Workshop" at <http://msdn.microsoft.com>. After installation make sure that
  the HHC.EXE executable is in the PATH.

COMCTRLS FIX

There was a problem with the comctrls unit in Delphi 5, which led to crashes in
applications running under Windows XP. Unfortunately Borland never fixed the
problem, so I had to patch the COMCTRLS.PAS file by myself. The file is not
included for legal reasons in the BFACSxxx.ZIP file, so you need to

1. Copy COMCTRLS from the Delphi installation folder into the VCLfix directory.
   Notice that only the Professional and the Enterprise version of Delphi 5
   contains this source code file from the VCL.

2. Look up the implementation of the TCustomListView.UpdateColumn method.

3. Replace the original code

        mask := LVCF_TEXT or LVCF_FMT or LVCF_IMAGE;

   with the following fix

        mask := LVCF_TEXT or LVCF_FMT;
        if FImageIndex >= 0 then
          mask := mask or LVCF_IMAGE;

Since BFACS.DPR includes this unit explicitely it be used for compilation
instead of the original one. If you have problems with this fix please let me
know, although I still won't be able to send you the file.

HOW TO BUILD BLOWFISH ADVANCED CS?

1. Unzip the BFACSxxxSRC.ZIP file. Make sure that folders are getting created.

2. Open a Command Prompt and CD into the bfacs directory.

3. Type "buildall". This batch file will then build everything from scratch.
   It takes usually around half a minute on a modern machine. At the end you
   should have all the files of Blowfish Advanced CS in the same directory.

4. Check out this BUILDALL.BAT files for details about the single steps. It's
   quite straightforward. Only the BFACSLIB.DLL library needs a separate
   makefile to compile and link all of its different submodules together.

5. Now you might also open BFACS.DPR in the Delphi IDE to browse the source
   code. There you will also be able to build BFACS.EXE seperately.
